/// `ValueObservation` tracks changes in the results of database requests, and
/// notifies fresh values whenever the database changes.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Tracked changes are insertions, updates, and deletions that impact the
/// tracked value, whether performed with raw SQL, or <doc:QueryInterface>.
/// This includes indirect changes triggered by
/// [foreign keys actions](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions)
/// or [SQL triggers](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html).
///
/// Changes to internal system tables (such as `sqlite_master`) and changes to
/// [`WITHOUT ROWID`](https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html) tables are
/// not notified.
///
/// ## ValueObservation Usage
///
/// 1. Make sure that a unique database connection, ``DatabaseQueue`` or
/// ``DatabasePool``, is kept open during the whole duration of
/// the observation.
///
///     `ValueObservation` does not notify changes performed by
///     external connections.
///     See <doc:DatabaseSharing#How-to-perform-cross-process-database-observation>
///     for more information.
///
/// 2. Create a `ValueObservation` with a closure that fetches the
/// observed value:
///
///     ```swift
///     let observation = ValueObservation.tracking { db in
///         // Fetch and return the observed value
///     }
///
///     // For example, an observation of [Player], which tracks all players:
///     let observation = ValueObservation.tracking { db in
///         try Player.fetchAll(db)
///     }
///
///     // The same observation, using shorthand notation:
///     let observation = ValueObservation.tracking(Player.fetchAll)
///     ```
///
///     There is no limit on the values that can be observed. An observation
///     can perform multiple requests, from multiple database tables, and use
///     raw SQL. See ``tracking(_:)`` for some examples.
///
/// 3. Start the observation in order to be notified of changes:
///
///     ```swift
///     let cancellable = observation.start(in: dbQueue) { error in
///         // Handle error
///     } onChange: { (players: [Player]) in
///         print("Fresh players", players)
///     }
///     ```
///
/// 4. Stop the observation by calling the ``DatabaseCancellable/cancel()``
/// method on the object returned by the `start` method. Cancellation is
/// automatic when the cancellable is deallocated:
///
///     ```swift
///     cancellable.cancel()
///     ```
///
/// `ValueObservation` can also be turned into an async sequence, a Combine
/// publisher, or an RxSwift observable (see the companion library
/// [RxGRDB](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB)):
///
/// - Async sequence:
///
///     ```swift
///     do {
///         for try await players in observation.values(in: dbQueue) {
///             print("Fresh players", players)
///         }
///     } catch {
///         // Handle error
///     }
///     ```
///
/// - Combine Publisher:
///
///     ```swift
///     let cancellable = observation.publisher(in: dbQueue).sink { completion in
///         // Handle completion
///     } receiveValue: { (players: [Player]) in
///         print("Fresh players", players)
///     }
///     ```
///
/// ## ValueObservation Behavior
///
/// `ValueObservation` notifies an initial value before the eventual changes.
///
/// `ValueObservation` only notifies changes committed to disk.
///
/// By default, `ValueObservation` notifies a fresh value whenever any component
/// of its fetched value is modified (any fetched column, row, etc.). This can
/// be configured:
/// see <doc:ValueObservation#Specifying-the-Tracked-Region>.
///
/// By default, `ValueObservation` notifies the initial value, as well as
/// eventual changes and errors, on the main dispatch queue, asynchronously.
/// This can be configured:
/// see <doc:ValueObservation#ValueObservation-Scheduling>.
///
/// `ValueObservation` may coalesce subsequent changes into a
/// single notification.
///
/// `ValueObservation` may notify consecutive identical values. You can filter
/// out the undesired duplicates with the ``removeDuplicates()`` method.
///
/// Starting an observation retains the database connection, until it is
/// stopped. As long as the observation is active, the database connection
/// won't be deallocated.
///
/// The database observation stops when the cancellable returned by the `start`
/// method is cancelled or deallocated, or if an error occurs.
///
/// Take care that there are use cases that `ValueObservation` is unfit for.
/// For example, an application may need to process absolutely all changes,
/// and avoid any coalescing. An application may also need to process changes
/// before any further modifications could be performed in the database file. In
/// those cases, the application needs to track *individual transactions*, not
/// values: use ``DatabaseRegionObservation``. If you need to process
/// changes before they are committed to disk, use ``TransactionObserver``.
///
/// ## ValueObservation Scheduling
///
/// By default, `ValueObservation` notifies the initial value, as well as
/// eventual changes and errors, on the main dispatch queue, asynchronously:
///
/// ```swift
/// // The default scheduling
/// let cancellable = observation.start(in: dbQueue) { error in
///     // Called asynchronously on the main dispatch queue
/// } onChange: { value in
///     // Called asynchronously on the main dispatch queue
///     print("Fresh value", value)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You can change this behavior by adding a `scheduling` argument to the
/// `start()` method.
///
/// For example, the ``ValueObservationScheduler/immediate`` scheduler
/// notifies all values on the main dispatch queue, and notifies the first
/// one immediately when the observation starts.
///
/// It is very useful in graphic applications, because you can configure views
/// right away, without waiting for the initial value to be fetched eventually.
/// You don't have to implement any empty or loading screen, or to prevent some
/// undesired initial animation.
///
/// The `immediate` scheduling requires that the observation starts from the
/// main dispatch queue (a fatal error is raised otherwise):
///
/// ```swift
/// let cancellable = observation.start(in: dbQueue, scheduling: .immediate) { error in
///     // Called on the main dispatch queue
/// } onChange: { value in
///     // Called on the main dispatch queue
///     print("Fresh value", value)
/// }
/// // <- Here "Fresh value" has already been printed.
/// ```
///
/// The other built-in scheduler ``ValueObservationScheduler/async(onQueue:)``
/// asynchronously schedules values and errors on the dispatch queue of
/// your choice.
///
/// ## ValueObservation Sharing
///
/// Sharing a `ValueObservation` spares database resources. When a database
/// change happens, a fresh value is fetched only once, and then notified to
/// all clients of the shared observation.
///
/// You build a shared observation with ``shared(in:scheduling:extent:)``:
///
/// ```swift
/// // SharedValueObservation<[Player]>
/// let sharedObservation = ValueObservation
///     .tracking { db in try Player.fetchAll(db) }
///     .shared(in: dbQueue)
/// ```
///
/// `ValueObservation` and `SharedValueObservation` are nearly identical, but
/// the latter has no operator such as `map`. As a replacement, you may
/// for example use Combine apis:
///
/// ```swift
/// let cancellable = try sharedObservation
///     .publisher() // Turn shared observation into a Combine Publisher
///     .map { ... } // The map operator from Combine
///     .sink(...)
/// ```
///
///
/// ## Specifying the Tracked Region
///
/// While the standard ``tracking(_:)`` method lets you track changes to a
/// fetched value and receive any changes to it, sometimes your use case might
/// require more granular control.
///
/// Consider a scenario where you'd like to get a specific Player's row, but
/// only when their `score` column changes. You can use
/// ``tracking(region:fetch:)`` to do just that:
///
/// ```swift
/// let observation = ValueObservation.tracking(
///     // Define what database region constitutes a "change"
///     region: Player.select(Column("score")).filter(id: 1),
///     // Define what to fetch upon such change
///     fetch: { db in try Player.fetchOne(db, id: 1) }
/// )
/// ```
///
/// This overload of `ValueObservation` lets you entirely separate the
/// **observed region** from the **fetched value** itself, providing utmost
/// flexibility. See ``DatabaseRegionConvertible`` for more information about
/// the regions that can be tracked.
///
/// ## ValueObservation Performance
///
/// This section further describes runtime aspects of `ValueObservation`, and
/// provides some optimization tips for demanding applications.
///
/// **`ValueObservation` is triggered by database transactions that may modify
/// the tracked value.**
///
/// Precisely speaking, `ValueObservation` tracks changes in a
/// ``DatabaseRegion``, not changes in values.
///
/// For example, if you track the maximum score of players, all transactions
/// that impact the `score` column of the `player` database table (any update,
/// insertion, or deletion) trigger the observation, even if the maximum score
/// itself is not changed.
///
/// You can filter out undesired duplicate notifications with the
/// ``removeDuplicates()`` method.
///
/// **ValueObservation can create database contention.** In other words, active
/// observations take a toll on the constrained database resources. When
/// triggered by impactful transactions, observations fetch fresh values, and
/// can delay read and write database accesses of other application components.
///
/// When needed, you can help GRDB optimize observations and reduce
/// database contention:
///
/// > Tip: Stop observations when possible.
/// >
/// > For example, if a `UIViewController` needs to display database values, it
/// > can start the observation in `viewWillAppear`, and stop it in
/// > `viewWillDisappear`.
/// >
/// > In a SwiftUI application, you can profit from the
/// > [GRDBQuery](https://github.com/groue/GRDBQuery) companion library, and its
/// > [`View.queryObservation(_:)`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/groue/grdbquery/documentation/grdbquery/queryobservation)
/// > method.
///
/// > Tip: Share observations when possible.
/// >
/// > Each call to `ValueObservation.start` method triggers independent values
/// > refreshes. When several components of your app are interested in the same
/// > value, consider sharing the observation
/// > with ``shared(in:scheduling:extent:)``.
///
/// > Tip: Use a ``DatabasePool``, because it can perform multi-threaded
/// > database accesses.
///
/// > Tip: When the observation processes some raw fetched values, use the
/// > ``map(_:)`` operator:
/// >
/// > ```swift
/// > // Plain observation
/// > let observation = ValueObservation.tracking { db -> MyValue in
/// >     let players = try Player.fetchAll(db)
/// >     return computeMyValue(players)
/// > }
/// >
/// > // Optimized observation
/// > let observation = ValueObservation
/// >     .tracking { db try Player.fetchAll(db) }
/// >     .map { players in computeMyValue(players) }
/// > ```
/// >
/// > The `map` operator helps reducing database contention because it performs
/// > its job without blocking database accesses.
///
/// > Tip: When the observation tracks a constant database region, create an
/// > optimized observation with the ``trackingConstantRegion(_:)`` method. See
/// > the documentation of this method for more information about what
/// > constitutes a "constant region", and the nature of the optimization.
